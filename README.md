## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Than install ngrok 
```bash
npm install -g ngrok 
# than start it with
ngrok http 3000 (along with npm run dev in another terminal)
```
## Why ngrok

Ngrok is a cross-platform application that creates secure tunnels (paths) to localhost machine. It enables developers to expose a local development server to the Internet with minimal effort. The software makes your locally-hosted web server (like computer, laptop, rasbery PI) appear to be hosted on a subdomain of ngrok.com, meaning that no public IP or domain name on the local machine is needed.
